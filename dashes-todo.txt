# Todo List

Things to be done to implement the changes described in
[issue 907](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/issues/907)

- [ ] fix get_help_topics() so it looks in self._help_methods
- [ ] fix enabling and disabling commands and categories
- [ ] make get_all_commands() look at the _command_methods dict
- [ ] make get_help_topics() look at _help_methods dict
- [x] add documentation showing how to make help that isn't associated
      with a command
- [ ] write documentation on renaming commands
- [ ] create decorator that does the same as rename_command
- [ ] create dashify-builtin-commands() method
- [ ] unit tests for get_help_topics()
- [ ] make get_all_commands() look at _command_methods
- [ ] in __init__ we verify that command names don't start with shortcuts. Do
      we have to do the same verification when we rename a command and throw an
      error if they map it to a shortcut name?
- [ ] write tests for cmd_func
- [ ] write tests for get_help_func

## Design principles

The unique thing that identifies a command is not the function, it's the name.
By default the name of the function defines the name of the command.

Renaming a command is therefore changing the primary identifier of that
command. When you do so, you are messing with everything else that uses that
primary identifier for the command, like hidden and disabled commands.





## Documentation Updates

- self.hidden_commands
- self.disabled_commands
