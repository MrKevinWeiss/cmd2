# Todo List

Things to be done to implement the changes described in
[issue 907](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2/issues/907)

- [ ] fix get_help_topics() so it looks in self._help_methods
- [ ] fix enabling and disabling commands and categories
- [ ] make get_all_commands() look at the _command_methods dict
- [ ] make get_help_topics() look at _help_methods dict
- [x] add documentation showing how to make help that isn't associated
      with a command


## Design principles

The unique thing that identifies a command is not the function, it's the name.
By default the name of the function defines the name of the command.

Renaming a command is therefore changing the primary identifier of that
command. When you do so, you are messing with everything else that uses that
primary identifier for the command, like hidden and disabled commands.





## Documentation Updates

- self.hidden_commands
- self.disabled_commands
